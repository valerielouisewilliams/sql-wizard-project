# Wizarding World SQL Database

Some practice designing a database + writing queries in a fun way ;p 

A fantasy-themed relational database built in MySQL to practice
schema design, joins, aggregation, subqueries, and constraints.

## Features
- 10+ relational tables with foreign keys
- Many-to-many relationships
- LEFT / INNER joins
- GROUP BY + HAVING
- Anti-joins (finding non-matches)
- DML practice (INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE)

## Tech
- MySQL 8
- SQL (DDL + DML)

## Files
- schema.sql      -- table definitions + constraints
- seed.sql        -- sample data
- practice.sql    -- questions + solved queries
  
## Learning Goals
This project focuses on understanding how joins and aggregation
interact, not on building an application layer.
